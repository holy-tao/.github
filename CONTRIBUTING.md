# Contributing

Contributions are welcome on all of my public repos. You can contribute in a variety of ways, including (but not limited to):
- [Opening a pull request](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/compare) with your changes - be sure to assign me as a reviewer!
- [Opening an issue](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/new/choose) to report a bug or request a feature.
    - Please check [existing issues](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues) first to avoid duplicates.
    - Note that I use issues liberally to track things that I want to do, including enhancements. If an issue is important to you, @ me directly to make sure I see it (or fix it yourself!).

Please note that I'm one guy, and I have a day job. This is a hobby and many of the things I make public are things I've found useful. This code is presented in the hope that it may be useful
to others, but I make no guarantees about anything.

## Environment Setup
This is my default CONTRIBUTING.md file. If you're reading it, you can assume that there's no special setup needed to get started with development on this project. If that assumption is wrong,
please open an issue!
